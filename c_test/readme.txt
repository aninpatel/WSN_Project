It's not complete
I have instances of things to implement
I will add more to it

One instance, putting nodes in a vector list
It checks the list to see if there are nodes that have a message. 
prints node number and message if it does. Prints number and no message if it doesnt 

Another instance:

Function start timer
Every 10 seconds, it counts one slot
Each slot, prints out node ID and message (this can be replaced to run a function from the node class)
Assign how many slots.
Can further implement frame and superframe
